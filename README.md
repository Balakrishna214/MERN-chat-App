# Project Overview 🚀  

This project is a **MERN** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack application enhanced with real-time capabilities using **Socket.io** and styled with **TailwindCSS** and **DaisyUI**. It demonstrates modern web development practices with a focus on user-centric features and seamless performance.  

## Features 🌟  
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Implemented secure login and signup flows with **JWT** tokens to protect user data.  
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Powered by **Socket.io**, enabling instant communication between users.  
- **Online User Status**: Dynamically display online/offline status with **Socket.io** and React's **Context API** for efficient state sharing.  
- **Global State Management**: Leveraged **Zustand** for lightweight and scalable global state management.  
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management on both the **server** and **client** sides to ensure a smooth user experience.  
- **MongoDB**: Used as the database for robust data storage and retrieval, enabling scalability and flexibility.  
- **React Hooks**: Enhanced the React app with hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and custom hooks for clean, reusable, and modular code.  

## Tech Stack 💻  
- **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database**: MongoDB  
- **Real-Time Communication**: Socket.io  
- **State Management**: Zustand  
- **Authentication**: JWT
